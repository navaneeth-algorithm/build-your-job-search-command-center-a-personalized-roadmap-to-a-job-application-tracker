# Task: Define Static Job Application Data

## Description
Create a JavaScript array of objects within your main component (e.g., App.jsx or a dedicated data file) to represent a few sample job applications. Each object should have properties like `id`, `company`, `role`, `status` (e.g., 'Applied', 'Interview'), and `dateApplied`.
