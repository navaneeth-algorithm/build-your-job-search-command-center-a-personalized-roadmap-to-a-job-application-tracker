# Build Your Job Search Command Center: A Personalized Roadmap to a Job Application Tracker

This roadmap guides you through building a personal job application tracker, designed to organize your job search effectively. Starting with foundational web development concepts, you'll progress to building a dynamic user interface with React, managing application data, and ultimately deploying a functional tool to streamline your job hunting process. This journey will enhance your skills in front-end development, data management, and practical application building.

## Requirements
- Display a list of job applications.
- Add new job applications with details (company, role, status, date applied).
- Edit existing job application details.
- Delete job applications.
- Filter and sort applications based on status, company, or date.
- Persist application data across sessions.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: JavaScript (ES6+)
- Web Framework/Library: React (v18.x)
- Build Tool: Vite (latest stable)
- Version Control: Git
- Data Persistence: LocalStorage (initial), potential for simple backend later

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application successfully loads and displays any previously saved job applications upon startup.
- Users can add new job applications through a form, providing company, role, status, and application date.
- Users can click an 'Edit' button on any application to modify its details, and changes are saved.
- Users can click a 'Delete' button on any application to remove it from the list.
- The application provides filtering options to display applications based on their status (e.g., 'Applied', 'Interview', 'Rejected').
- The application provides sorting options to reorder the list by 'Company Name' and 'Date Applied' (ascending/descending).
- All additions, edits, and deletions of job applications are persistently saved (e.g., to LocalStorage) and loaded correctly across browser sessions.
- The user interface is intuitive, responsive, and provides clear feedback for user actions.
- The project includes a production build ready for static hosting.

## Structure
Each phase of this roadmap exists as a separate Git branch (phase-1, phase-2, etc.) to keep focus on specific milestones. Each phase branch contains a README.md with phase details and milestone tasks.
